Arduino code for interactive panels in ScienceWorks

Designed for use in an interactive multiple-choice question panel. Buttons are grouped into three questions, pressing a button from a question group will light up a coresponding LED. When all three questions have been answered, a fourth LED is lit and all four are held for a predetermined delay.
